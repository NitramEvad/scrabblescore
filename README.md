Scoring app for Scrabble...hopefully putting an end to cheating allegations!

After many an accusation of improper score-keeping during alcohol assisted Scrabble games, and further claims of improprietry over the use of dictionaries, I decided to the put the issue to rest and build an app to prevent a diplomatic incident.

## Features
- score calculator,
- cricket-like worm for running progress on score difference,
- timer, so we can see how much time each players wastes in rumination,
- a single source of truth - a dictionary, giving only the absolute minimum amount of information - does the word exist and what is its meaning
